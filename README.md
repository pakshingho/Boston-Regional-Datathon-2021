COVID-19 has brought to the world as much division and mistrust as physical suffering and deaths. Countries have adopted the mindset to help themselves, while alienating working with countries claimed to be “epicenters” or those with policies different to their own. Within the same country itself, sections of the society have divided themselves into subgroups obeying rules that benefit them, while turning a blind eye to other rules at the expense of other subgroups of society. This study shows that moving away from COVID-19 will take a more **concerted effort from all countries and all subgroups within countries**, and this will be beneficial to all groups involved.

More specifically, we first explore **the effects countries have on each other**. The success of fighting COVID-19 in a specific country involves coordinating policies with neighboring countries. Moreover, we explore the effects, different age groups, within the same country have on each other, and **how reducing the impact on a specific age group will require other age groups adhering to policies that apply to them as well**. The following results support our conclusions:
- Countries that are **geographically close** to each other experience similar COVID-19 severity to COVID-19 waves in terms of correlation and lead-lag synchronicity (Fig. A).
- Responses of **different age groups** within a country are also closely related to each other.
- In most cases there are **time lags** in response between two sections, the time lags are very informative information on preventing the spread of the disease (Fig. B). 
- The implication of our work includes:
  - Policy-makers should **take the relationship of different sections into account**. For example, how reopening its border affects the neighboring countries or how reopening schools affects the health well-being of the elders. 
  - Countries should **work together when implementing a policy** in order to achieve the best effects.
